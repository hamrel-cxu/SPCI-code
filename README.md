# SPCI code
 Official implementation of the work "Sequential Predictive Conformal Inference for Time Series" (ICML 2023). 
 
 Please direct questions regarding implementation to cxu310@gatech.edu.
 
 See [tutorial_electric_EnbPI_SPCI.ipynb](https://github.com/hamrel-cxu/SPCI-code/blob/main/tutorial_electric_EnbPI_SPCI.ipynb) for comparing SPCI against EnbPI, which is an earlier method of ours. We demonstrate significant reduction in interval width on the electric dataset, which is also used in [Nex-CP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13415) (Barber et al., 2022).
